                    Pundra (also known as Pundrabardhan Bhukti, Paundra, Paundraya, etc.) was the branch of one of the most developed civilizations of ancient west Bengal, now a part of northern Bangladesh. The civilization of Pundra was not established overnight it had to go through the evolutionary process of thousands of years. A considerable number of Bangladeshi people today are actually the successors of the people of the Pundra civilization.

                <p>
                    We cannot deny the fact that we are very much indebted to the Pundra civilization for all that we have today for example, our education, culture, customs, social values etc. Pundra civilization represented a huge prosperous mixed population with its strong central government it had a strong administrative and political system along with an enriched economic background of a well-established commercial center. With a sophisticated touch of water tank technology, Pundra was one of the important civilizations which had a cluster of villages surrounded by noticeable walls all along.

                    To talk about its technology, it should be mentioned that its walls had been built three hundred years before the Great Wall of China. Its agriculture developed on a splendid combination of the river ‘Karatoa’ and other lakes; and in fact, this formed the basic layout of Pundra civilization. With the succession of Stone Age, Iron Age, Bronze age; the Pundra civilization flourished from every aspect navigation, astrology, astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, theology etc. Furthermore, it helped flourish art and literature for example, epic, folk literature, and other types of literature especially those that survived orally generations after generations came into written text at that time. The Pundra civilization showed a great thirst for knowledge; the establishment of the ancient university ‘Vashubiharh’ stood as a testimony of that. The social ideas, values, customs, philosophy, and humanity of the Pundra civilization soon earned a worldwide recognition.

                <p>
                    The Pundra University of Science and Technology has been established with a noble intention to uphold and keep alive all the values of the great Pundra civilization. With such a naming of the university and such intentions as mentioned above, we desire to take part in the world’s history and domain of knowledge.
